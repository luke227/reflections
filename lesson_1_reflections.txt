How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
  it show only what was changed. 
  
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
  makes it faster to find differences. 
  
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, 
like Google Docs does?  
  pro - you create more logical commits.
  cons - no auto backup.
  
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others,
like Google Docs, treat each file separately?  
    it depends on how the files releate to each other. -- if independent, you can track each file spearaelty, but in prg where they depend git is better.
    
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
   log shows history of commits, diff shows files diffs.
   
   
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
   I could track down which change broke the code.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
   work. -- keep track of changes.
